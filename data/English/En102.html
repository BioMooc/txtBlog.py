<h2>20190826 economist | The Amazon: On the brink</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The Amazon is approaching an irreversible tipping point. //临界点</li>
	<li>THE AMAZON basin, most of which sits within the borders of Brazil, contains 40% of the world’s tropical forests and accounts for 10-15% of the biodiversity of Earth’s continents. //占了x% ,两种表达</li>
	<li>Over the same period, the average temperature in the basin has risen by about 0.6°C. This century, the region has suffered a series of severe droughts. //温度升高... 经历一系列干旱</li>
	<li>They had begun to suspect that, if tree loss passed a certain threshold, the deforestation would start to feed on itself. Beyond this tipping-point, forest cover would keep shrinking whatever humans might try to do to stop it.</li>
	<li>As well as spelling extinction for tens of thousands of species, that devastation would change weather patterns over much of South America and release into the atmosphere tens of billions of tonnes of carbon, worsening global warming. //spelling?</li>
	<li>In 2012, under then-president Dilma Rousseff, Brazil’s congress passed a new forest code that gave amnesty to those who had taken part in illegal deforestation before 2008. //code[熟词生义]法案 //</li>
	<li>The president appears to want the country to return to the time of Brazil’s military dictatorship, when big infrastructure projects prompted widespread destruction in the name of development. //以...的名义</li>
	<li>These statistics tell only part of the story. The Amazon matters to the global climate because it is a sink of carbon, mitigating warming. //减缓气候变暖</li>
	<li>But the climate matters to the Amazon, too. It is sensitive to changes in temperature and rainfall, as well as to atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels. //这就是辩证法</li>
	<li>This is what has led to worries about tipping-points. In an influential paper in 2007 Gilvan Sampaio and Carlos Nobre of Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research forecast that, were 40% of the forest to perish, the loss of water-recycling capacity would mean very little of the rest would have enough rainfall to survive. //虚拟语气</li>

<h2>20190712 BBC | Up, up and away</h2>
<ol>
	<li>It's more than 100 years since the Wright Brothers. But humanity has never stopped dreaming of flying free like a bird.</li>
	<li>In the Greek myth, inventor Daedalus fashioned wings from willow branches, feathers and wax to create a means of escape from prison for himself and his son. //[熟词僻义] fashion vt. 使用；改变；做成…的形状</li>
	<li>Was this a warning against human arrogance, or a prophecy about the inevitable conquest of the skies? If it was a warning, it was not heeded. //反问句： 这是...还是...？</li>
	<li>Future-gazing city planners always envisaged flying cars and planes - life in three dimensions. //展望未来的城市规划者 //envisage 设想</li>
	<li>Low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, EasyJet, AirAsia and Southwest Airlines brought short-haul destinations within reach of almost everyone. //短途目的地 short-haul destinations</li>
	<li>Catching a plane became like catching a bus, and the number of air passengers ballooned. //balloon v 激增</li>
	<li>More recently climate change reared its head and environmental imperatives – the need to reduce noise and carbon dioxide emissions – began to take precedence. //抬头 reared its head //take precedence = take priority 优先，后面可以跟 over sth</li>
	<li>But necessity is the mother of invention, and this recent environmental driver has spawned a new era of innovation which Daedalus would have appreciated. //需求是创新之母 //spawn 酿成，引发</li>
	<li>Standing on an airstrip on a cold grey day in Donauwörth, southern Germany, watching Airbus's scale model octocopter rise into the air, it’s hard to imagine the radical transformation in urban mobility that this prototype – and others like it - could herald. //预示着herald //城市交通(urban mobility)的根本性转变(radical transformation)</li>
	<li>Dedicated air traffic management systems will ensure safety, and people will soon become comfortable with the idea of autonomous aircraft and the benefits they can bring – greater convenience, less pollution, less congestion. //自动驾驶飞机带来的好处</li>
	<li>This is a really big dream for us... We want to transform urban mobility. //表决心</li>
	<li>In an emergency, the central automated air traffic management system would take over, he says. //紧急时刻 //接管</li>
	<li>Marius Bebesel's CityAirbus team, which is benefiting from tens of millions of euros in development cash from its aircraft manufacturing parent Airbus, aims to have a full-size demonstrator up and flying by the end of 2018. //团队从母公司获取资金 //定语从句</li>
